\maketitle

A linear type system is characterised by the fact that all the
resources available in the context have to be used exactly once
by the term being checked. In traditional presentations of
intuitionistic linear logic this is achieved by representing
the context as a multiset and, in each rule, cutting it up and
distributing its parts among the premises. This is epitomised
by the introduction rule for tensor (cf. Figure~\ref{rule:tensor}).

However, multisets are an intrinsically extensional notion and
therefore quite arduous to work with in an intensional type
theory. Various strategies can be applied to tackle this issue;
most of them rely on using linked lists to represent contexts
together with either extra inference rules to reorganise the
context or a side condition to rules splitting the context so
that it may be re-arranged on the fly. In the following example,
$≈$ stands for ``bag-equivalence'' of lists.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule
 {Γ ⊢ σ \and Δ ⊢ τ
}{Γ, Δ ⊢ σ ⊗ τ
}{⊗_i}

\and \inferrule
 {Γ ⊢ σ \and Δ ⊢ τ \and Γ, Δ ≈ Θ
}{Θ ⊢ σ ⊗ τ
}{⊗_i}
\end{mathpar}
\caption{Introduction rules for $⊗$.
         Left: usual presentation;
         Right: with reordering on the fly\label{rule:tensor}}
\end{figure}

All of these strategies are artefacts of the unfortunate mismatch
between the ideal mathematical objects one wishes to model and
their internal representation in the proof assistant. Short of
having proper quotient types, this will continue to be an issue
when dealing with multisets. The solution we offer tries not to
replicate a set-theoretic approach in intuitionistic type theory
but rather strives to find the type theoretical structures which
can make the problem more tractable. Given the right abstractions,
the proofs follow directly by structural induction.

McBride's recent work~\cite{McBride2016} on combining linear and
dependent types highlights the distinction one can make between
referring to a resource and actually consuming it. In the same spirit,
rather than dispatching the available resources in the appropriate
sub-derivations, we consider that a term is checked in a \emph{given}
context on top of which usage annotations are super-imposed.

A derivation $Γ ⊢ σ ⊠ Δ$ corresponds to a proof of $σ$ in a context $γ$
with input usage annotations $Γ$ and output usage annoations $Δ$.
Informally, the resources used to prove $σ$ correspond to the difference
between the ones available in $Γ$ and the \emph{leftovers} present in $Δ$.
Wherever we used to split the context between sub-derivations, we now
thread the leftovers from one to the next. Writing $f_{σ}$ for a
\emph{fresh} resource of type $σ$ and $s_{σ}$ for a \emph{stale} one,
we can give the following new introduction rules for tensor and the
linear implication, two examples characteristic of the treatment of
context splitting on one hand and context extension under a binder
on the other:

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule
 {Γ ⊢ σ ⊠ Δ \and Δ ⊢ τ ⊠ Θ
}{Γ ⊢ σ ⊗ τ ⊠ Θ
}{⊗_i}

\and \inferrule
 {Γ ∙ f_{σ} ⊢ τ ⊠ Δ ∙ s_{σ}
}{Γ ⊢ σ ⊸ τ ⊠ Δ
}{⊸_i}
\end{mathpar}
\caption{Introduction rules for $⊗$ and $⊸$ with leftovers\label{rules:leftovers}}
\end{figure}

This approach is particularly well-suited to use intuitionistic linear
logic as a type system for an untyped $λ$-calculus where well-scopedness
is statically enforced: in the untyped calculus, it \emph{is} the case
that both branches of a pair live in the same scope. In our development,
we use an inductive family in the style of Altenkirch and Reus~\cite{Altenkirch1999}
and opt for a bidirectional presentation~\cite{Pierce:2000:LTI:345099.345100}
to minimise the amount of redundant information that needs to be stored.

Type-inference (resp. Type-checking) is then inferring (resp. checking)
a term's type but \emph{also} annotating the resources consumed by the
term in question and returning the \emph{leftovers}. These typing
relations can be described by two mutual definitions. The definitions in
Figure~\ref{rules:leftovers} would for instance become:

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule
 {Γ ⊢ σ ∋ a ⊠ Δ \and Δ ⊢ τ ∋ b ⊠ Θ
}{Γ ⊢ σ ⊗ τ ∋ (a, b) ⊠ Θ
}

\and \inferrule
 {Γ ∙ f_{σ} ⊢ τ ∋ b ⊠ Δ ∙ s_{σ}
}{Γ ⊢ σ ⊸ τ ∋ λb ⊠ Δ
}
\end{mathpar}
\caption{Type\emph{checking} rules for pairs and lambdas\label{rules:checking}}
\end{figure}

For this mechanisation to be usable, it needs to be well-behaved with
respect to the natural operations on the underlying calculus (renaming
and substitution) but also encompass all of ILL. Our Agda formalisation
(available at \url{https://github.com/gallais/typing-with-leftovers})
states and proves the following results for a system handling types of
the shape:
\[σ, τ, ... ::= α \,|\, 𝟘 \,|\, 𝟙 \,|\, σ \,⊸\, τ \,|\, σ \,⊕\, τ \,|\, σ \,⊗\, τ \,|\, σ \,\&\, τ\]

\begin{lemma}[Framing] The usage annotation of resources left untouched
by a typing derivation can be altered freely. The change is unnoticeable
from the underlying $λ$-term's point of view.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Weakening] The input and output contexts of a typing
derivation can be expanded with arbitrarily many new resources. This
corresponds to a weakening on the underlying $λ$-term.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Parallel Substitution] Given a term and a typing derivation
corresponding to each one of the fresh resources in its typing derivation's
context, one can build a new typing derivation and a leftover environment.
The corresponding action on the underlying $λ$-term is parallel substitution.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Functional Relation] The typing relation is functional: for
given ``inputs'', the outputs are uniquely determined. It is also the case
that the input context is uniquely determined by the output one, the term
and the type.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Typechecking] Type checking (resp. Type inference) is decidable.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Soundness] Typing derivations give rise to sequent proofs
in ILL.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Completeness] From a sequent proofs in ILL, one can build a
pair of an untyped term together with the appropriate typing derivation.
